But as the tide of internationalization rose, a port was established and Yokohama began to grow as a gateway to Japan. Yokohama is now a leading international trading port, the second largest city in Japan after Tokyo. Situated just a short distance along the coast from the Japanese capital, and within easy reach of Haneda Airport, Yokohama is now a magnet for tourists not just from Japan but from every corner of the world; it's a place everyone wants to visit. Minato Mirai 21 is a modern urban development that was created, and continues to evolve, on 186ha of land. A shipbuilding facility that used to divide Yokohama's two main urban centers on Tokyo Bay was relocated, and additional land was reclaimed from the sea. In 1989 an exposition was held to mark the 100th anniversary of Yokohama's city status and the 130th anniversary of the opening of Yokohama Port. Following that event development gathered momentum, and now the area boasts office blocks, commercial facilities, hotels, amusement parks and convention facilities, as well as such cultural amenities as art museums and concert halls. This, the new face of Yokohama, offers an entire spectrum of urban functions and attracts more than 70 million visitors every year. Minato Mirai 21 is full of great experiences. The liberating expanse of Tokyo Bay and the dynamic appeal of the contemporary architecture contribute to the area's strikingly unusual beauty, which you can enjoy from the elegant surroundings of several first-class hotels. For the shopper, more than 600 stores offer an astonishingly broad selection of goods ranging from top fashion brands to animation character merchandise. Apart from excellent Japanese cuisine, delicious food from around the world is available at more than 200 restaurants. Theme parks offer exciting rides, parks a place to sit and enjoy the seascape. Packed with pleasure, Minato Mirai 21 is a fun place to visit with family and friends at any time of year, on any occasion, and for so many different reasons. If you move on to the area beyond Minato Mirai 21, you'll find intriguing glimpses of a fascinating history in the Kannai district, which developed quickly in the second half of the 19th century after the Port of Yokohama opened, and beyond Kannai you'll arrive at Japan's largest Chinatown. Yokohama offers points of interest that no other city can match. And just a day trip away are some of the best hot spring baths in Japan at Hakone, as well as the globally renowned beauty of Mt. Fuji. So after a day of fun in Minato Mirai 21, you can spend the night at one of the area's great hotels and then the next day you can be soaking in an onsen or admiring a view of Mt. Fuji. That is the special appeal of a relaxing holiday based in Japan's new leading tourism and leisure destination: Minato Mirai 21..

Located at King Power Mahanakhon, you'll be able to see the glistening rooftops of Wat Pho temple, the Grand Palace, Chao Phraya River, and even the Gulf of Thailand on a clear day. You can enjoy the views from the indoor observation deck on the 74th floor, or upgrade your ticket to include The SkyWalk on the 78th floor where you'll find the glass trays—glass floors that make you feel like you're suspended in the sky. Snap some cool photos while you're up in the air—photography is allowed but you're required to keep all loose items and wear shoe covers. – Tripadvisor.

It was established in 1988 with the inauguration of the new Cairo Opera House. Its goal is to promote the arts of music and dance and to preserve and renew traditional Arab music. In order to be more than just a place where music and art are performed the National Cultural Centre wants to give space to learning and inspiration, to the exchange of ideas, the respect of a common cultural heritage, and a shared passion for the arts. It encourages interest for music and art in the younger generation by offering ballet, voice or instrumental classes for talented children or youths. Performances of ballet, operatic or symphonic works are staged with Egyptian companies or in cooperation with foreign ensembles or soloists. Seminars and cultural conferences covering a wide range of artistic and intellectual issues are held regularly. Opera House companies are frequently sent on tours to different Egyptian governorates to give the people in urban areas the chance to see national and international art performances. In March 1985, Former President Mubarak laid the first corner stone of the new Cairo Opera House which was to be built with the support of JICA, the Japan International Cooperation Agency. Careful planning by the Ministry of Culture in Cairo and the JICA produced a design suggestive of traditional Islamic architecture and blending in harmoniously with the surrounding buildings. In October 1988,Former President Mubarak and His Highness, Prince Tomohito of Mikasa, the younger brother of the Japanese Emperor, inaugurated the National Cultural Centre “Cairo Opera House” in a remarkable ceremony. It was the first time for Japan to stage a Kabuki show, a traditional popular drama with singing and dancing, in Africa or the Arab World..
